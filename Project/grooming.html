	Small dog grooming
</h1>
<p class="p">
For small dog owners we offer a specialised service for your dog in order to keep them comfortable and happy. We understand that smaller dogs are more prone to anxiety while being groomed and in order to ease their anxiety we offer ear and face covers if needed. We also have smaller baths for your dog, so they feel more comfortable.
